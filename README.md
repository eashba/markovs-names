# Markov's Names

## What is this?

This is a simple name generator that utilizes Markov Chains to procedurally generate new, unique names from an original dataset of existing names. This project relies heavily on Foswig.js for its Markov Chain implementation.

## Dataset Sources

The names in the various datasets on this site come primarily from Gary Gygax's Extraordinary Book of Names, which is no longer in print. Datasets are simple JSON files, so this project's generators can be easily extended by adding more. Custom datasets are on the todo list.
